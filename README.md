# Overview

In this repository you can find my final assignments for the "Digital Analytics" and "Data Journalism" classes.  

I also updated and wrote a few RSS-scrapers for my Master Thesis. Those can be found here: https://github.com/uvacw/inca/tree/master/inca/rssscrapers

The scrapers I updated are the ones for "Die SÃ¼ddeutsche", "Der Tagesspiegel", and "Die Welt". The newly written ones are for "Aachener Zeitung", "Rheinische Post", and "Stuttgarter Zeitung".
